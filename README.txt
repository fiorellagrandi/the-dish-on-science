The Dish on Science Website
Author: Bruno Beltran <brunobeltran0@gmail.com>

Uses Flask to populate a couple of simple templates with posts and "team" names
from JSON files.

SqlAlchemy is used to keep track of page views, and to sort posts by team,
author, etc.

Duties:
-------
Editor -- should make sure that post_info.json looks reasonable, that the folder name
matches the "url_name" in post_info.json, should put a "publication_date" field
into post_info.json, then run unpack-new-posts.sh
Website Administrator -- pick up the pieces when the above workflow explodes in
the poor Editor's face
