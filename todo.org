* TODO Finish website
  * Immediate Goals
    ** twitter button should go to twitter page
    ** article should be shareable via twitter
    ** put "topics" next to the three bars for team names
    ** Make sure to uncomment Stanford's name after club app goes through (2 places)
    ** sort team names in pop-out menu
    ** include link to science dictionary at bottom of the pop-out menu and
    ** move facebook like and twitter buttons to the post itself, and make them point to each specific article instead of to the webpage as a whole
    ** increase spacing slightly between three "menu" bars and the "Close menu" text
  * Large Goals
    ** set up a SQL server using sqlalchemy to store the articles
      *** various things become more manageable once this is done:
        **** actually sort posts
        **** actually track pageviews
        **** pagination.
        **** Make sure to switch to first 5 most popular posts and first 10 most recent posts
    ** make a page to look at a specific author's articles, with optional bio at top
      *** hook up author links
    ** don't let website fail on startup if there's a bad post file
  * Strech Goals
    ** ?Login system? + comments
    ** Post list page
    ** Science dictionary
    ** Search box
  * URL Scheme:
    http://thedishonscience.com/topics/$topic_name
    http://thedishonscience.com/posts/$year/$post_name
  * Objects (to Jay: this is probably outdated, the code is the docs)
