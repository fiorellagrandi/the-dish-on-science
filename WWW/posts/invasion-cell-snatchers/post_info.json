    "description": "How can cells that are very far apart in the body influence each other? The cells in our multicellular body can control each other from a distance. This article is about a novel form of cell-to-cell communication that involves sending out little packets of information that can ‘reprogram’ the recipient cell, much like the invasion of a body by an alien force. This type of communication, using structures called exosomes,control both communication during health, but also during disease.",
